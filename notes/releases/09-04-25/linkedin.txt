My cofounder and I noticed that even in the age of AI, the experience and speed on integrating it to our products is still quite bad. 

Integrating with a single provider means looking up models in confusing pricing pages, reading extensive docs and dealing with not-so-great UIs. And that's not even counting integrating models from multiple vendors or keeping up with new model releases...

So we built Itzam! 

It's an AI integration service. We designed and built it with user delight and DX in mind, so experimenting and deploying AI-powered apps isn't tedious anymore.

By integrating you get:
- Interactive playground with > 25 models from 7 different providers 
- Test prompts and models before using them with your customers - if you liked the result, just sync the changes with 1 click!
- Unified billing platform, keeping it simple to track AI expenses
- Runs analytics and tracking
- Model and prompt hot swapping - no deploy required
- A production ready SDK for integrating to your services - great dx btw
- $5 free trial to spend in tokens for 30 days - no credit card required
