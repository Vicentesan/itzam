For example, let's imagine you want to create a support chat in your landing page and want it to be powered by AI. 

Here’s how you would do this with Itzam:

### Dashboard

Everything starts in the dashboard, where you will create a Workflow. A Workflow represents a functionality in your app, in this case, the support chat.

1. Create a Workflow called “Support Chat”.
2. Inside your Workflow you can configure:
    - AI model (GPT o1, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2)
    - Prompt (e.g. “You are a customer support agent from Acme Inc…”)
    - Model settings (temperature, max tokens) - soon
    - Context (what the model will use as context, e.g. company docs, company logo, links) - soon
3. Now create a new API key in the dashboard.
4. Great! Now grab this Workflow’s slug and your API key and let's integrate!

### SDKs

Now it’s time to add the Workflow to your app. 

1. Install the SDK:

```bash
npm i itzam
```

2. Use the API key to authenticate:
    
```jsx
import Itzam from "itzam";

const itzam = new Itzam("my-great-api-key");
```
    
3. Use the Workflow’s slug to run it with your user’s input:
    
```jsx
const response = await itzam.generateText({
  input: "I am having trouble finding your documentation...",
  workflowSlug: "support-chat",
});

// response = "Follow this link to access our documentation: acme.com/docs"
```


### API

If you prefer, you can also use the API directly.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"input": "Hello, world!", "workflowSlug": "my_great_workflow"}' \
  https://itz.am/api/v1/generate/text
```
