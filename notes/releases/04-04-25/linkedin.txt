🤖 AI Integrations Shouldn’t Be This Hard

AI is evolving faster than ever, but integrating it into products is still a mess:
❌ Hardcoded models (GPT, Claude, Gemini)
❌ Every prompt change requires a deploy
❌ Only devs can manage AI workflows

We built **Itzam** to fix this.

With a simple dashboard & API, you can:
✅ Swap AI models instantly
✅ Update prompts & context without touching code
✅ Let non-technical teams manage AI

Here’s a quick demo: Building a customer support chatbot in under 1 minute! 🎥👇
