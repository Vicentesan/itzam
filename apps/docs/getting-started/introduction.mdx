## Welcome

With Itzam, you can seamlessly integrate AI into your applications.

Our API and SDKs are pretty straightforward and easy to use. Most of the configuration
is done through the Itzam dashboard.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using API Keys. You can create one in the [API
keys section](https://itz.am/dashboard/api-keys) of the Itzam dashboard.

Now, you can use the API key to authenticate your requests.

In the API:

```bash Bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"input": "Hello, world!", "workflowSlug": "my_great_workflow"}' \
  https://itz.am/api/v1/generate/text
```

In the SDKs:

{/* TODO: Add more SDKs (see https://mintlify.com/docs/content/components/code-groups) */}

```typescript TypeScript
import Itzam from "itzam";

const itzam = new Itzam("YOUR_API_KEY");

const response = await itzam.generateText({
  input: "Hello, world!",
  workflowSlug: "my_great_workflow",
});
```

## Error Codes

We use standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

| Status Code | Description                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 200         | The request was successful.           |
| 400         | The request was invalid.              |
| 401         | The request was unauthorized.         |
| 404         | The requested resource was not found. |
| 429         | The request was rate limited.         |
| 500         | An error occurred on our end.         |
