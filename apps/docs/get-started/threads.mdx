Threads allow you to easily create a conversation inside a Workflow.

A thread is a collection of messages between a user and the AI.

You can create as many threads as you want inside a Workflow:

## Create a thread

First of all, you need to create a thread (think of it as a chat session).

### SDK

```javascript
const thread = await itzam.threads.create({
  workflowSlug: "customer-support",
  name: "Chat for user 123", // optional
  lookupKeys: ["user-123", "platform-web-app"], // optional
});

console.log(thread.id); // "thread_424242" (save this ID in your database)
```

### API

```bash
curl -X POST https://itz.am/api/v1/threads \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ITZAM_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"workflowSlug": "customer-support", "name": "Chat for user 123", "lookupKeys": ["user-123", "platform-web-app"]}'
```

## Send messages

After creating a thread, you can use its ID when sending new messages.

This will make the AI continue the conversation and remember all previous messages.

```javascript
const message = await itzam.generateText({
  threadId: "thread_424242",
  input: "Hello, I'm Gustavo, how are you?",
});

console.log(message.content); // "I'm doing well, thank you!"

// If you use the same thread ID, the AI will continue the conversation
const message = await itzam.generateText({
  threadId: "thread_424242",
  input: "What's my name?",
});

console.log(message.content); // "Your name is Gustavo"
```

## Check threads

You can check how a thread is going by clicking in the threads option inside any run.

You can also use our API or SDKs to get the thread by its ID or by Workflow.

## Check runs

You can check the runs using our API or SDKs.
