Title: We Built a Platform to Make AI Integration Easier – Itzam




Text:
We’ve been frustrated with how hard it is to integrate AI into applications. Right now, AI workflows are:

Hardcoded into business logic

Locked to a single model (GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)

Difficult to update—every prompt or model change requires code changes & redeploys

Only manageable by developers

So we built Itzam, a platform that lets you manage AI workflows through a dashboard & API.

With Itzam, you can:
- Swap AI models instantly
- Update prompts & context without redeploying
- Let non-devs manage AI workflows
- Optimize AI costs (e.g., auto-switch to cheaper models)

It’s designed to make AI integration flexible and future-proof.

Would love to hear your thoughts & feedback!
