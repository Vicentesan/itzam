Welcome to the Itzam documentation!

Here you will learn how to create AI features in your projects using Itzam.

## How it works

Let's use a real-world example to understand how Itzam works.

Imagine you want to create an AI support chat.

### Workflow

Everything starts in the dashboard, where you will create a **Workflow**. A Workflow represents a functionality in your app, in this case, the support chat.

1. Create a Workflow called "Support Chat".

2. Inside your **Workflow** you can configure:

   - **AI model** (GPT, Claude, Gemini)
   - **Prompt** (e.g. "You are a customer support agent from Acme Incâ€¦")
   - **Model settings** (response length, style)
   - **Knowledge** (what the model will use as context, e.g. docs, links)

3. Now create a new API key in the dashboard.

4. Great! Now grab this **Workflow**'s slug (in this case, `support-chat`) and your API key and let's integrate!

You have two options to integrate this **Workflow** in your app:

### SDKs

1. Install the SDK:

```bash
npm i itzam
```

2. Use the API key to authenticate:

```jsx
import Itzam from "itzam";

const itzam = new Itzam("itzam_81d443ca-3952-4c53-bfda-7...");
```

3. Use the **Workflow**'s slug to run it with your user's input:

```jsx
const response = await itzam.streamText({
  input: "Where is your documentation?",
  workflowSlug: "support-chat",
});

// response = "Follow this link to access our documentation: acme.com/docs"
```

### API

If you prefer, you can also use the API directly.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"input": "Hello, world!", "workflowSlug": "my_great_workflow"}' \
  https://itz.am/api/v1/stream/text
```

## Nice work! ðŸŽ‰

You have created your first **Workflow** and integrated it in your app.

Now you can manage everything about it in the dashboard. You can:

### Change the **AI model**

### Update the **model settings**

### Tweak the **prompt**

### Add **knowledge** (docs, links, etc.)

### Check your **runs**

### Make tests in **playground**
