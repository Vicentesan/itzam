### Workflows

Workflows are the building blocks of Itzam. They represent a specific functionality in your app (e.g. a support chat, a code generator, a content writer, etc).

A Workflow contains:

- **Model**: The AI model you want to use (e.g. GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, etc).
- **Prompt**: The prompt you want to give to the model (e.g. "You are a customer support agent from Acme Inc...").
- **Knowledge**: The files and links you want the AI to use as context (e.g. company docs, wikipedia links, etc).
- **Runs**: The runs are the executions of a workflow.

### Runs

Runs are the executions of a workflow. You can think of them as the logs or history of a workflow.

A Run contains:

- **Input**: The input (i.e. question) your user provided to the model.
- **Output**: The output (i.e. answer) the AI model generated.
- **Prompt**: The prompt you provided to the model.
- **Knowledge**: The files and links the model used as context to answer the question.
- **Cost**: The cost of the run (in dollars).
- **Duration**: The duration of the run (in milliseconds).
- **Metadata**: Other metadata about the run (e.g. input tokens, output tokens, etc).

### Playground

The playground is a tool that allows you to test your workflow with different parameters.

### Providers

Providers are the companies that offer AI models. E.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, etc.

### Models

Models are the AI models that you can use in Itzam. E.g. GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, etc.

### Providers tokens

Providers tokens are the tokens used to interact with the AI model. There are 2 types of providers tokens:

- **Input Tokens**: The tokens you send to the AI model (e.g. your prompt, the user's message, the context).
- **Output Tokens (or Completion Tokens)**: The tokens the AI model generates (e.g. the model's response).

Here you can check more details about providers tokens: [AI Tokens Explained](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-tokens-explained/).

### Knowledge

Knowledge is the data you provide to the AI model to use to answer a question (e.g. documents, links).

### Prompt

Prompt (or System Prompt) is the instructions you provide to the AI model to use to generate text. E.g. "You are a customer support agent from Acme Inc...".
