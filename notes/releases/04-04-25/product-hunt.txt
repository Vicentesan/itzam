🔸 Itzam – Integrate AI seamlessly

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I’m excited to introduce Itzam, a platform that makes AI integration seamless.

🔍 The Problem

Right now, integrating AI into applications is messy:
❌ AI logic mixed with business logic
❌ Non-technical teams can’t modify AI workflows
❌ Changing AI models or prompts requires redeploys
❌ Keeping up with new AI models is a headache

⚡ The Itzam Solution

Itzam provides a dashboard & API that lets you:
✅ Hot-swap AI models (GPT, Claude, Gemini) instantly
✅ Empower non-dev teams to manage AI workflows 
✅ Update prompts & context (soon) without changing code
✅ Optimize costs with AI provider switching rules (soon)

🛠️ How It Works

1️⃣ Configure your AI workflow in our dashboard (choose a model, set a prompt, define context)
2️⃣ Integrate with 3 lines of code using our API & SDKs
3️⃣ Manage AI without touching your code—switch models, update prompts, and adjust settings effortlessly

🎯 Who is this for?

Developers who don’t want to hardcode AI into their apps

Product & Ops teams who need to tweak AI settings without dev help

AI-heavy startups looking for flexibility & cost control

> Everyone who wants AI without the hassle

🔥 Why Now?

AI is evolving fast—you shouldn’t be stuck with a single provider or a rigid integration. Itzam lets you stay agile and future-proof your AI stack.
