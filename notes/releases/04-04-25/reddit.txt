### **🔸 We Built a Platform to Make AI Integration Effortless – Meet Itzam**  

Hey [!!! 🚨 NAME OF THE SUBREDDIT 🚨 !!!] 👋  

AI is evolving fast, but integrating it into applications is still a **pain**. Right now, AI workflows are:  
❌ Hardcoded into business logic  
❌ Locked to a single model (GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)  
❌ Only manageable by devs  
❌ A nightmare to update—every prompt change needs a redeploy  

We built **Itzam** to solve this.  

### **⚡ What Itzam Does**  
Itzam gives you a **dashboard & API** to manage AI without friction:  
✅ **Hot-swap models** instantly (e.g., GPT → Claude → Gemini)  
✅ **Modify prompts & context (soon)** without touching code  
✅ **Empower non-technical teams** to control AI workflows  
✅ **Optimize costs** (e.g., auto-switch to a cheaper model when needed) (soon)

### **🛠️ How It Works**  
1️⃣ Set up an AI workflow in the **dashboard** (pick a model, set prompts, define context)  
2️⃣ Use **3 lines of code** to integrate it with our **API & SDKs**  
3️⃣ Manage your AI setup **without redeploying**  

### **🔍 Why Does This Matter?**  
AI adoption is skyrocketing, but companies struggle to keep up with new models & providers. Hardcoding AI integrations **locks you in**—we make them **flexible** and **future-proof**.  

### **💡 Who is this for?**  
- Devs who don’t want to rewrite AI logic constantly  
- Product teams who need to tweak AI without engineering bottlenecks  
- AI startups looking to stay agile and control costs  

### **💬 We’d Love Your Feedback!**  
We just launched and would love to hear your thoughts. Do you face these problems? How are you managing AI in your apps today?
